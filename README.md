## About Me

I am a computer science graduate student focused on building production-ready AI systems, distributed computing pipelines, and intelligent automation tools. My work combines machine learning, real-time systems, scalable cloud architectures, and full-stack development. I enjoy solving complex engineering problems, designing end-to-end ML pipelines, and integrating advanced models into real applications.

Beyond AI and systems engineering, I build Android applications, architect interactive web tools, and experiment with reinforcement learning, networking simulations, and software infrastructure.
